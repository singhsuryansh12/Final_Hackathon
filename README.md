# Final_Hackathon
**revenant_final_hack_winter19**

Our app aims to ease the burden upon current students. This **Flutter** based app consists of a _Stacking-Regressor_ based prediction system and _content-filtering_ based recommendation system.
This app uses the user's Linkedin Profile to gain information about his/her skils and achievements. Then this information is used to recommend jobs/courses to the user.
The prediction model can also take user's input on his academic performance to predict his chances of getting in a MS program in a US based University.

__This project was a part of the Final Hackathon of CodeAsylums Bootcamp__
